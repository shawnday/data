## 10. DH6015 Communities of Practice in Digital Scholarship
This module looks at collaboration and communities of practice which are such an important feature of digital culture. Students will use social media, blogs and discussion forums to review, summarise and discuss  readings. 
In this module, students will be introduced to the range of theories, tools and practices which support current collaborative scholarly work in the Digital Humanities. Students will explore and evaluate the emerging digital communities and collaborations among scholars, review the literature and debates on the changing nature of scholarship, on communities of practice, peer review, collaboration and "critical friends". The changing nature of academic debate and the impact of digital tools in research and on the production of academic work and topics such as digital rights management, licensing and copyright will be studied. Students will engage with local, national and international networks, and begin to develop a professional digital "presence".
Each student will submit a portfolio of collected blog posts, forum posts, responses to other students blogging and forum posts,  an academic poster, a podcast and other shared public digital work. The main thrust is to demonstrate the students’ abilities to participate in scholarly communities both within the course and within the broader academic community, and to reflect on the use of digital tools for collaboration. 
Students in groups of 3-5 will submit collaborative essays on key topics.. Groups will be formed in September based on shared interests, with a view to writing intensively during October.

## 20. Writing in Digital Humanities
Scholarship in the Digital Humanities is not only digital, but open and collaborative, and expressed in a wide variety of media. In this course you will produce content in a range of media – you will engage in critical discussions both in class, online in the 'confines' of the Blackboard LMS, and publicly in social media – twitter and blogs. 
Types of work which you will produce during the courses, which will build towards final assessments, will include:

- Twitter and other short form writing to express ideas concisely
- Discussion posts in forums where you exchange ideas about core readings and issues with other students in a few paragraphs
- Blog posts where you reflect on and  refine ideas to present them for public discussion.
- Presentations using tools like Powerpoint and Prezi to integrate text and visual presentations of ideas. 
- Conference posters and infographics which also present information and ideas visually.
- Podcasts, both audio and video
Across this range of 'writing' you will demonstrate developing ability to:
- Locate relevant sources and critically evaluate the worth of various sources
- Monitor the flow of digital discourse on topics relevant to the course
- Make sense of the information, and extract key points through reading summaries, abstracts, mind maps, tweets of key points etc
- Plan digital 'writing' by producing plans and drafts for essays, presentations, podcasts etc
- Participate in peer review and helpful critique of the plans and drafts of colleagues
- Produce final pieces of work of an appropriate quality for masters level work and ready for public presentation.
This will be challenging, but it will be exciting and by the end of the process you will be able to respond flexibly to the opportunities of the digital age. 
## 21. Digital Presence
Developing and maintaining a professional public digital presence is an important part of the Digital Humanities. 
During this course you will “walk the walk” of engaging with social media, blogging, collaborative work online, and by then end of the course – and hopefully much sooner – it is expected that you will demonstrate your ability to do this. 
This will require you to have accounts on several social network sites, and you need to consider some issues about this:
You may want to keep you’re your digital footprints separate and distinct – you may want to maintain division between personal online activity, experimental online work during the course where you try out new tools, and your professional digital footprint. 
You may therefore decide to maintain 2 or 3 different accounts on some services
You will need to consider account names, screen names and passwords for all of these. You want these to be easy to remember, and secure. All will need to come back to an email account for signup and password recovery. 
All of this can be organised and tracked on one page, if you have a system and are careful. 
## 22. Backups and Security
You are also responsible for keeping copies of your digital work for the course. There are many ways to do this – many students use College email to email copies of work  to themselves,  there are several online services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Skydrive, Evernote and Zotero which offer a level of free storage.  USB keys are now relatively cheap. Most of these options will certainly provide enough space to store as much text as you will deal with during the year, but large media files will need more space. 
Work out a backup and “Business Continuity Plan” for your work that works for you
Have backups in several clearly separate and distinct places/services so that if one fails, the other(s) are safe. 
The “internet ate my homework” will not be acceptable as an excuse in this course!
## 23. Online Learning overview 
One page with useful links on personal learning, time management, study skills, 
Can we find a good guide? 
Weekly reading load (200-250 pages) 
weekly writing load – 10-12 discussion contributions (blog, blog comments, forums, twitter) 
End of term assignment load – 10,000-12,000 words, mainly collected from online participation into course portfolio
Submission: All Final submissions will be done by uploading required materials to assignments in the course sites on Blackboard. 
## 24. Talk Nice to Archivists
## 25. Ethnographic research ethics 
## 26. Core Readings (additions?)
These are by no means the only or the best long-form works in the field, but they do embody the central issues and debates at this time. Selected chapters will be required in various courses, and the course team strongly recommend that you have physical or electronic copies of these texts which will serve as the foundation of a professional library in the area.  Some of these are available as open online texts

W3C World Wide Web consortium Standards for the world wide web - excellent, open site with great links you can trust for factual, up - to - date information on contemporary thinking about web technologies - the introduction at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission is excellent.
Jaron Lanier on youtube  (at 23 minutes in)Lanier's recent book 'You are not a gadget' is about the primacy of the individual in the digital domain, and his worries about the 'hive mind', and what happens to people when they are 'anonymised people'.  It is, depending on your perspective, a dystopian or prophetic view of the web from within -and a necessary to read.
Clay Shirky's article on ontologies (2005) 'Why ontologies are overrated'.  Shirky is known for his ideas about cognitive surplus, there are a number of his TED talks too.  Here he gives the example of the Periodic Table of Elements as an almost perfect ontology, almost.

## Glossary of Key terms: all via w3c
### The semantic web:
In addition to the classic “Web of documents” W3C is helping to build a technology stack to support a “Web of data,” the sort of data you find in databases. The ultimate goal of the Web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The term “Semantic Web” refers to W3C’s vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and SKOS.
### Linked Data
linked data - XML technologies... all at W3C and also the basics are introduced via w3schools.com
### Data
A useful beginning description of DATA is here:   http://www.systems-thinking.org/dikw/dikw.htm
### The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a consortium which collectively develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in digital form.
